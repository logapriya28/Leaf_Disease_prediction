I successfully completed a machine learning project titled "RiceLeaf Disease Detection" with a focus on classifying three major diseases affecting rice plants:
-leaf blast
-bacterial blight
-brown spot
The project comprised three main tasks, each contributing to the overall goal of developing an effective disease detection model.
In the first task, I meticulously conducted a comprehensive data analysis on the provided dataset, consisting of 120 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves.
The dataset was divided into three classes, namely Leaf smut, Brown spot, and Bacterial leaf blight, with 40 images in each class.
My data analysis report included an exploration of the dataset's characteristics, statistical summaries, and visualizations to gain insights into the distribution and features of the images. 
This initial analysis laid the foundation for the subsequent model development.

For the second task, I designed and implemented a machine learning model capable of classifying the three major diseases affecting rice plants. 
The model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between leaf blast, bacterial blight, and brown spot, showcasing its efficacy in disease detection.

In the third task, I delved into the exploration of various techniques to enhance the model's performance.
I particularly focused on data augmentation, a crucial method for increasing the diversity of the training dataset and improving the model's generalization.
The report detailed the implementation and impact of data augmentation techniques, providing insights into how they contributed to the model's ability to handle variations in disease-infected rice leaf images.
